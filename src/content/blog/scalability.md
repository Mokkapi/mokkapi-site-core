# Scalability

Mokkapi is designed to be scalable in a few different ways. 

## Functionality

Built on top of Django and open source, means there are many ways you can scale out the functionality in whatever direction you desire. Be sure to check out and vote on our roadmap before you do any custom development, since we may build that functionality for you.

## Users

Since you are hosting the app, you can add as many users as you desire. The only increase in cost would be if you needed to upgrade the hosting hardware. 

## Endpoints

You can create as many endpoints as you like in whatever direction or formulation you need. Build them in the user interface, or programmatically by POSTing to the add endpoint. Be sure to check out our best practices so you can manage large numbers of endpoints efficiently.
