# Performance

There are a few different types of performance we care about at Mokkapi. First is on the app level and has to do with stability. The second has to do with using the app, ie time to value. The third has to do with endpoint availability. The final one has to do with cost to run the application, or what we'd term the total cost of ownership TCO.
