# North Star

Our company and product philosophy is fairly simple. We want to help our users and then get out of the way. The TLDR up front so to speak. This means we sell software as our core business offering. 

## Marketing

This has had an interesting impact on our marketing strategy. We don't plan to meticulously track our customers on our website, drop cookies and UTM codes everywhere, and create all kinds of ads to increase traffic. We also don't have a salesforce. 

We think the product is helpful, and are willing to give it away for free to prove it to you (though we hope you come back and pay us, as per the license agreement). We want our marketing material to be valuable in its own right. This includes honesty, for example our performance post will tell you all about what it can and probably can't do. We'll try to give you the full picture, not just the best possible picture. 

## Product

We believe the product should stick to its core value prop, and just that. We are emphatically not going to build a platform out of the product (maybe we'll build a platform as another product, but that's a discussion for another day). 

## Operations

We are building this product in public, so for those interested you can follow along on that blog; madebyphil.com
